# CV Generator using Create-React-App
https://nilryan.github.io/cv-project/
A ReactJS app I built using create-react app. This project made me apply and know more about the concept of state and props. Both class components and functional components were used. I also learned to handle multiple input forms while doing this project. 

## Learning Outcomes
  1. React class components and functional components
  2. State and Props both using class and functional components
  3. useState hook
  4. Rendering lists using Higher Order Functions (map, filter)
